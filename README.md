## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the hover state of the equilibrium image, I learned that its easier to hover over the parent's element than the image itself. This works if the parent element has a higher z-index than both the images and for z-index to happen its position needs to be set.
